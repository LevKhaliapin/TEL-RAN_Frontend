            Geomorphic characteristics
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mountainous terrains have certain unifying characteristics. Such terrains have higher elevations than do
            surrounding areas. Moreover, high relief exists within mountain belts and ranges. Individual mountains, mountain
            ranges, and mountain belts that have been created by different tectonic processes, however, are often
            characterized by different features.

            Chains of active volcanoes, such as those occurring at island arcs, are commonly marked by individual high
            mountains separated by large expanses of low and gentle topography. In some chains, namely those associated with
            “hot spots” (see below), only the volcanoes at one end of the chain are active. Thus, those volcanoes stand
            high, but with increasing distance away from them erosion has reduced the sizes of volcanic structures to an
            increasing degree.

            The folding of layers of sedimentary rocks with thicknesses of hundreds of metres to a few kilometres often
            leaves long parallel ridges and valleys termed fold belts, as, for example, in the Valley and Ridge province of
            Pennsylvania in the eastern United States. The more resistant rocks form ridges, and the valleys are underlain
            by weaker ones. These fold belts commonly include segments where layers of older rocks have been thrust or
            pushed up and over younger rocks. Such segments are known as fold and thrust belts. Typically their topography
            is not as regular as where folding is the most important process, but it is usually dominated by parallel ridges
            of resistant rock divided by valleys of weaker rock, as in the eastern flank of the Canadian <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Rocky-Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> or
            in the Jura Mountains of France and Switzerland.

            Tectonic processes that create and destroy mountain belts and their components
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mountains and mountain belts exist because tectonic processes have created and maintained high elevations in the
            face of erosion, which works to destroy them. The topography of a mountain belt depends not only on the
            processes that create the elevated terrain but also on the forces that support this terrain and on the types of
            processes (erosional or tectonic) that destroy it. In fact, it is necessary to understand the forces that
            support elevated terrains before considering the other factors involved.

            The last decadal survey, published in 2011, recommended that the community prioritize a multi-pronged Mars
            sample return mission. NASA’s Perseverance rover is currently completing the first phase of this assignment as
            it traverses the red planet’s surface, collecting and storing Martian rock and dirt for eventual return to
            Earth. The 2011 survey also recommended a mission to Jupiter’s icy moon Europa, which is one of the most
            promising places in the solar system to search for life. That led to the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is
            scheduled to launch in 2024.

            Mechanisms that support elevated terrains
        </h3>
        <p>
            Two properties of rocks contribute to the support of mountains, mountain belts, and plateaus, namely strength
            and
            density. If rocks had no strength, mountains would simply flow away. At a subtler level, the strength of the
            material beneath mountains can affect the scale of the topography.
        </p>
        <p>In terms of strength, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/lithosphere">lithosphere</a>, the thickness of which varies over the face of the Earth from a few to
            more than 200 kilometres, is much stronger than the underlying layer, the asthenosphere (see plate tectonics).
            The strength of the lithosphere is derived from its temperature; thick lithosphere exists because the outer part
            of the Earth is relatively cold. Cold, thick, and therefore strong lithosphere can support higher mountain
            ranges than can thin lithosphere, just as thick ice on a lake or river is better able to support larger people
            than thin ice.
